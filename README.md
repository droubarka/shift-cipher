# Shift-Cipher

## Description
The **Shift Cipher**, also known as the **Caesar Cipher**, is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter a certain number of positions further down the alphabet. This number of positions is sometimes called a **key**.
The encryption and decryption processes involve shifting the letters by a fixed number of positions, wrapping around to the beginning of the alphabet when necessary.

The encryption formula is `E_n(x) = (x + n) mod 26`, where `x` is the plaintext letter, `n` is the shift value, and `mod 26` ensures that the result is within the range of the alphabet.

The decryption formula is `D_n(x) = (x - n) mod 26`, which is the inverse of the encryption formula.
